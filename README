START provides tools to perform a full analysis with H.E.S.S. data.
It is based on a likelihood maximization procedure and it allows :
 
- To find the best estimation for the parameters of an hypothesis-model 
- To compute and draw confidence intervals 
- To draw likehood as a function of one parameter 
- To draw informations about your data set 
- To draw informations about the IRF (used or not) 
- To draw the main spectrum (spectrum, points, butterfly and residuals) 
- To draw light curves 

The code is written in C++ in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) way.
We use library provided by [ROOT](href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/)'s
framework, [MINUIT2](http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/MathLibs/Minuit2/html/)
and the best algorithms for numerical integration and interpolation 
from the GNU Scientific Library ([GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)).

START was initially developped at [APC](http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/) by:
- [Julien Lefaucheur](https://github.com/jjlk)
- Vincent Maradon
- Santiago Pita
